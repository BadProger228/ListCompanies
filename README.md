# ListCompanies

**ListCompanies** is a desktop application built with **C# and WinForms**, designed for managing employees across multiple companies. This is one of the earliest applications I created, and although the code quality reflects my beginner experience, it implements a surprisingly rich set of features that bring it close to being a fully usable utility.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-company support**: Users can create multiple companies and assign employees to each of them.
- **Data portability**: Each project is saved in a user-specified folder. All data is stored there, including XML records and images. These folders can be copied and opened on another machine with the same application without any issues.
- **Employee and company images**: Users can attach photos to both employees and companies.
- **File-based persistence**:
  - All data is stored in XML format within the project folder.
  - Optionally export data to a TXT summary file (read-only, like PDF for Word).
- **Recent files menu**: The app includes a recent projects list (like in Visual Studio) to quickly reopen previously accessed files.
- **Sorting & search**:
  - Companies and employees can be sorted alphabetically.
  - Employees can also be sorted by age.
  - A search function allows filtering employees by name.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note

This is my very first desktop application, created during the early stages of my programming journey. The code is not perfect, but it shows my drive to build functional, real-world software even at the beginner level.

Despite its rough edges, the app stands as one of my most feature-rich projects.
